<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerial Lift Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Grip Chairlift</li><li>Detachable Chairlift</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerial lifts are commonly divided into two main types: fixed grip chairlifts and detachable chairlifts. Fixed grip chairlifts have chairs that are permanently attached to the cable, making it slower and more suitable for shorter distances or lower capacity. Detachable chairlifts, on the other hand, have chairs that can detach from the cable at terminals, offering faster speeds and higher capacity for longer distances. Both types serve the same purpose of transporting skiers and snowboarders up mountain slopes efficiently and safely.</p></p>
