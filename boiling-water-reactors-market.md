<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiling Water Reactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Cycle Steam Generation</li><li>Dual Cycle Steam Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) are used for single cycle steam generation, where the nuclear reactor produces steam that is then used to generate electricity in a single cycle. On the other hand, BWRs can also be used for dual cycle steam generation, where the steam produced by the reactor is used in two separate cycles to generate electricity more efficiently. This allows for higher energy output and increased overall efficiency in power generation.</p></p>
