<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open breathing circuits allow for the exchange of fresh gas and exhaled gas without recycling or rebreathing. Semi-open breathing circuits partially recycle exhaled gas, while also allowing fresh gas to be added. Closed breathing circuits completely recycle exhaled gas, minimizing waste and gas consumption. These different types of breathing circuits offer varying levels of patient ventilation and gas exchange efficiency based on the amount of fresh gas provided and the extent of gas recycling.</p></p>
