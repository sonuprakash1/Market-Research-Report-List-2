<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Patch Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Singlemode Fiber Optic Patch Cables</li><li>Multimode Fiber Optic Patch Cables</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic patch cables are classified into two main types based on the type of fiber used: singlemode and multimode. Singlemode fiber optic patch cables are designed for long-distance, high-speed data transmission with a smaller core size and a single mode of light propagation. On the other hand, multimode fiber optic patch cables are ideal for short-distance data transmission with a larger core size that allows multiple modes of light to propagate. Both types cater to different networking requirements and are widely used in various industries.</p></p>
