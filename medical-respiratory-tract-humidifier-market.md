<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Respiratory Tract Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Respiratory Tract Humidifier Market can be classified into two types- Active Type and Passive Type. Active Type humidifiers require a power source to function and actively heat and humidify the air before delivering it to the patient. Passive Type humidifiers, on the other hand, do not require a power source and rely on the patient's own breathing to pass through a humidifying chamber. Both types serve the same purpose of providing humidified air to patients with respiratory issues, but differ in their method of operation.</p></p>
