<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plate Falling Film Evaporator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Effect</li><li>Multiple-Effect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plate falling film evaporators can be classified into two types based on their number of effects: single-effect and multiple-effect. </p><p>Single-effect evaporators have one evaporation effect with one set of plates for heat transfer, making them simpler and less energy-efficient compared to multiple-effect evaporators. Multiple-effect evaporators, on the other hand, have multiple sets of plates for heat transfer, allowing for the reuse of heat and energy, making them more complex but more energy-efficient and cost-effective in the long run.</p></p>
