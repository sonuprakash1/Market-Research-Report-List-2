<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sonar Buoy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sonar Buoy</li><li>Passive Sonar Buoy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sonar buoys are devices used in underwater surveillance and detection systems. There are two main types of sonar buoys: active sonar buoys and passive sonar buoys. Active sonar buoys emit sound waves into the water and analyze the returning echoes to detect objects or underwater activity. Passive sonar buoys, on the other hand, listen for sound waves emitted by other sources such as vessels or marine life. Both types play a crucial role in marine security, research, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
