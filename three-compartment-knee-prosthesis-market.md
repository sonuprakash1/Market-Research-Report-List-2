<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three compartment Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cemented bone knee prostheses involve using bone cement to adhere the implant to the patient's existing bone, providing immediate stability and fixation. This type of prosthesis is often preferred for older patients with weaker bone structure. Non-cemented bone knee prostheses rely on ingrowth of the patient's bone into the implant for stability. This type is typically used for younger, more active patients with strong bone density. Both options aim to improve mobility and reduce pain in patients with knee joint issues.</p></p>
